# Premier-League-Stat-Attack
An RShiny interactive dashboard showcasing Premier League results and xG data sourced from ESPN and Understat, respectively.

The inspiration for this analysis came from George Pipis' R-bloggers post on 7th March 2021 (https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/03/how-to-build-a-predictive-model-for-nba-games/). Some of the code used to scrape data from understat.com was sourced from ewenme's understatr package on GitHub (https://github.com/ewenme/understatr).
